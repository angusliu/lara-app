### where to put script tags in html
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/436411/where-should-i-put-script-tags-in-html-markup

# The old approach to solving this problem was to put <script> tags at the bottom of your <body>, because this ensures the parser isn't blocked until the very end.

<!-- put scripts or anything required DOM to be loaded right before the end of body tag -->
<script src="path/to/script.js"></script>
</body>
</html>

# modern use
sequential:
<script src="path/to/script.js" defer></script>

async (unordered):
<script src="path/to/script.js" async></script>
